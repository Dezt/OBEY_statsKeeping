The trophy server isi meant to be moddable, so doesn't require any database or special setup.  
Simply upload these files, change the password in passwords.php, and set that password in your OBEY server's settings.

By editting leaderboardPostTest.php you can change what each symbol means or what they look like.  Your OBEY server will be pinging the php with the results of each game, and you can change it to do what you want.
